Why do we "sensory-motor" input so basically controller function?
Classical approach would be to do system identification and then design suitable controller for the system

dynamics
what about modelling of dynamics of the systems?
how good can we control a system where we don't model dynamics?
do we need to look into "sufficient exitation" to explore the space of the dynamics sufficiently?
can we approximate lower order dynamics? or approximate by simple non-linear functions

Parameters
how is the parameter dependency of system? spring config, "yarn" elasticity + strength, temperature?
how good can we set/measure the parameters?
